# Online Payment Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project is part of my internship and focuses on detecting fraud payments using various machine learning models. It leverages essential Python libraries for data handling, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation using various metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Accuracy Score
  - Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed and then install the required libraries using:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Apply feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
4. Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
5. Visualize and analyze the model performance.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by improving the model performance or adding new features.
